Prolegomenon
------------

- What makes one of many possible senses rise to the level of an event?
- What makes a message different than a directed expression?
- When an expression is observed does it become an event?
- Is the heuristic which differentiates the concept of communication helpful?
- Does the categorization of sense and message impose:
    a. At best: post hoc experience on a priori data?
    b. At worst: developer design on relevance?
